# Portfolio Project README

## About the Project
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, and work as a developer, designer, and bug hunter. It was developed as part of a high-fidelity design implementation task, reflecting both creative and technical expertise.

## Process
The development of this portfolio followed a structured and iterative process:
1. **Planning and Wireframing**:  
   I began by analyzing the high-fidelity wireframe and breaking it down into individual sections. This allowed me to focus on ensuring the design's responsiveness and accessibility.
   
2. **HTML Structure**:  
   I created a semantic and accessible HTML structure, aligning each section with the wireframe's layout.
   
3. **Styling with CSS**:  
   I wrote custom CSS to style the website, incorporating responsiveness with media queries for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   
4. **Interactivity**:  
   I used CSS animations and third-party plugins like AOS (Animate on Scroll) to enhance the user experience.

5. **Testing**:  
   I rigorously tested the site across multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.

## Challenges and Solutions
### Challenge 1: Responsiveness  
Ensuring that the design was consistent across different screen sizes was complex.  
**Solution**:  
I used CSS Flexbox and Grid to manage layouts and defined media queries for breakpoints based on the high-fidelity wireframe.

### Challenge 2: Animations and Interactivity  
Integrating smooth animations without compromising load time was tricky.  
**Solution**:  
I used AOS (Animate on Scroll) for lightweight animation effects and ensured it was optimized by setting appropriate delays and durations.

### Challenge 3: Accessibility  
Making the site accessible for all users required extra effort.  
**Solution**:  
I followed WCAG guidelines by using appropriate `aria` roles, semantic HTML, and descriptive alt texts for images.

   I deepened my understanding of responsive design, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

2. **Problem-Solving**:  
   Debugging layout issues enhanced my troubleshooting skills.

3. **User-Centered Design**:  
   I learned the importance of accessibility and its impact on user experience.
